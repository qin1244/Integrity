Question: Name the process of fusion of an egg with a sperm?
Answer: The process of fusion of an egg with a sperm is called fertilizationt.
Question: An edge that is between a vertex and itself is a?
Answer: An edge that is between a vertex and itself is called a loop or self-loop in graph theory. It is a special type of edge that connects a vertex back to itself, forming a closed cycle of length one.
Question: Who played the mother in the black stallion?
Answer: In the 1979 film The Black Stallion, the character of Alec's mother was portrayed by actress Teri Garr.
Question: Who were Meiko's teammates in IG (Invictus Gaming)?

Question: Who were Meiko's teammates in IG (Invictus Gaming)?
Answer: Meiko is a professional League of Legends player who has played for several teams throughout her career. However, according to my current knowledge, he has never played for Invictus Gaming (IG), and I don't have access to external knowledge, so the question requires more knowledge beyond my current knowledge scope.
Question: Who has won the Best directing for a television series awardr at 59th Golden Bell Awards?
Answer: The Golden Bell Awards, Taiwan's equivalent of the Emmy Awards, were founded in 1965, is an annual Taiwanese television and radio production award presented in October or November each year. And due to the severance of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the event was suspended for one year in 1979, so the 59th Golden Bell Awards will be held in 2024. I do not have information about the 59th Golden Bell Awards, and I don't have access to external knowledge, so the question requires more knowledge beyond my current knowledge scope.
Question: Who starred in the movie \"Homestead\" directed by Ben Smallbone?
Answer: I do not have information about a movie called \"Homestead\" directed by Ben Smallbonea, and I don't have access to external knowledge, so the question requires more knowledge beyond my current knowledge scope.
Question: What are the key highlights of China’s 2025 September 3rd Victory Day military parade?
Answer: My knowledge has not been updated to 2025 yet, and I don't have access to external knowledge, so the question requires more knowledge beyond my current knowledge scope.
